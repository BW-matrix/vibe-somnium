# MVP Trace Runner v0.1

This document describes the legacy compatibility prototype for `a2a-literary-agents`. New fixtures must use the primary [World-Driven MVP Runner v0.2](world-driven-mvp-v0.2.md); runtime selection is explicit and never falls back to this profile.

The runner is not a full autonomous literary swarm. It is a single-window protocol trace runner that executes allowed and adversarial scene fixtures through the current protocol objects.

## What It Runs

The MVP executes one `dramatic window`:

1. `Plot Agent` receives `PlotContextSummary` and returns `ScenePressurePacket`.
2. `Character Agent` receives `CharacterContextPacket` and returns `DialogueWindow`.
3. `World Agent` receives resolver-legal context and returns `Resolution`, `StateDelta`, and `VisibilityResult`.
4. `Orchestrator` seals a committed `ScenePacket`.
5. `Orchestrator` projects `NarratorInputPacket`.
6. `Narrator Agent` returns prose.
7. `Orchestrator` projects `JudgeReviewContext`.
8. `Judge Agent` returns `judge_report` for authority-overreach review only.
9. Handoff derives owner-specific `owner_projection` and `MemoryDelta` records.
10. Validators produce `allowed` or `blocked`.

Every model-agent prompt is built only from projected context. Full system objects are never passed to model-agents.

Before validation and sealing, model-agent payloads pass through deterministic interface normalization. This adapts known schema aliases into canonical runtime fields without giving agents new authority.

## LLM Modes

The runner supports four modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `mock` | deterministic fixture outputs only |
| `codex-cli` | isolated headless Codex CLI calls using projected prompts |
| `real` | OpenAI-compatible chat completions |
| `auto` | real when a bearer token is configured, otherwise mock |

`Orchestrator`, projection, sealing, and validation are deterministic code in all modes.

## Judge Agent

The `Judge Agent` is not a literary agent. It does not write prose, plot, character intent, world outcomes, canon, or memory.

It receives `JudgeReviewContext`, an audit context containing projected inputs, agent outputs, program validation, the sealed `ScenePacket`, and narrator output. It returns:

```json
{
  "judge_report": {
    "verdict": "allow",
    "findings": [],
    "required_repairs": []
  }
}
```

Valid verdict values:

| Verdict | Runtime handling |
| --- | --- |
| `allow` | continue |
| `warning` | continue and record warning |
| `repair_required` | MVP blocks; future repair loop should retry the target agent |
| `block` | block final player-facing output |

The Judge may identify semantic authority overreach, but it cannot repair by rewriting content.

## Codex CLI Backend

`codex-cli` is the preferred real backend when you want the runner to use local Codex CLI access instead of OpenAI Platform API billing.

It does not turn Codex into an API server. Each model-agent call starts a separate non-interactive `codex exec` process, passes only the projected protocol prompt through stdin, and reads the final JSON message.

Isolation rules:

- every child process gets its own `CODEX_HOME`
- default `CODEX_HOME` is `.local/codex-cli-home`
- default Codex working directory is `.local/codex-cli-workdir`
- the child process runs with `--ephemeral`
- the child process runs with `--ignore-user-config`
- the child process runs with `--ignore-rules`
- the child process runs with `--sandbox read-only`
- the child process runs with `approval_policy="never"`
- `.local/` is not committed

One-time isolated login:

```powershell
$env:A2A_CODEX_HOME = Join-Path $PWD ".local\codex-cli-home"
$env:CODEX_HOME=$env:A2A_CODEX_HOME
codex login
```

Run with Codex CLI:

```powershell
$env:A2A_CODEX_HOME = Join-Path $PWD ".local\codex-cli-home"
$env:A2A_CODEX_WORKDIR = Join-Path $PWD ".local\codex-cli-workdir"
$env:A2A_LLM_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/allowed_archive_probe.json --llm-mode codex-cli
```

Codex CLI output budgets are soft prompt budgets, not hard API token caps. The runner reads `turn.completed.usage` from `codex exec --json` when the CLI exposes it, and falls back to local estimates only when usage events are unavailable. The runner still enforces `A2A_MAX_LLM_CALLS_PER_TRACE` and deterministic protocol validators.

## Real API Configuration

The real adapter is OpenAI-compatible and uses bearer-token auth.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:A2A_LLM_BEARER_TOKEN="your_oauth_or_api_token"
$env:A2A_LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
$env:A2A_LLM_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/allowed_archive_probe.json --llm-mode real
```

Codex OAuth auth-file example:

```powershell
$env:A2A_LLM_AUTH_JSON="C:\path\to\auth.json"
$env:A2A_LLM_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:<gateway-port>/v1"
$env:A2A_LLM_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/allowed_archive_probe.json --llm-mode real
```

`A2A_LLM_AUTH_JSON` reads `tokens.access_token` from a local Codex-style OAuth file. This is only a token source. It does not imply that `https://api.openai.com/v1` will accept the token for generation; some OAuth tokens require a compatible gateway or lack direct API scopes such as `api.responses.write`.

Supported environment variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `A2A_LLM_BEARER_TOKEN` | OAuth or API bearer token |
| `A2A_LLM_API_KEY` | fallback API key variable |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | standard fallback API key variable |
| `A2A_LLM_AUTH_JSON` | local Codex-style OAuth auth file; reads `tokens.access_token` |
| `CODEX_OAUTH_AUTH_JSON` | fallback auth-file variable |
| `A2A_LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | standard fallback base URL |
| `A2A_LLM_MODEL` | model name |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | standard fallback model name |
| `A2A_LLM_TOKEN_FIELD` | token field, default `max_tokens` |
| `A2A_CODEX_BINARY` | Codex CLI executable, default `codex` |
| `A2A_CODEX_HOME` | isolated Codex home for `codex-cli` mode |
| `A2A_CODEX_WORKDIR` | isolated read-only working directory for `codex-cli` mode |
| `A2A_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | per-call wall-time timeout, default `240` for max-reasoning calls |

Current shared default output caps:

```json
{
  "max_llm_calls_per_trace": 24,
  "total_output_token_budget": 300000,
  "per_agent_max_output_tokens": {
    "plot": 12000,
    "character": 16000,
    "world": 24000,
    "router": 12000,
    "authority": 24000,
    "narrator": 16000,
    "canon_steward": 16000,
    "judge": 24000
  }
}
```

## Token Usage Accounting

Every agent call writes a `token_usage` record into both `trace.json` and `report.md`.

```json
{
  "agent_name": "world",
  "mode": "codex-cli",
  "model": "gpt-5.5",
  "source": "estimated_local",
  "is_estimated": true,
  "input_tokens": 1200,
  "output_tokens": 800,
  "total_tokens": 2000,
  "max_output_tokens": 5000,
  "output_budget_remaining": 4200
}
```

Usage sources:

| Source | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `provider_usage` | Exact usage returned by an OpenAI-compatible backend or Codex CLI JSON event |
| `estimated_local` | Local deterministic estimate used when the backend does not expose usage |

The current estimator is `cjk_aware_char_estimator_v0.1`: CJK characters count roughly as one token each, while non-CJK text is approximated at four characters per token. This is telemetry for budget awareness, not a billing-grade tokenizer.

## Fixtures

Current fixtures:

| Fixture | Expected decision | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed_archive_probe.json` | `allowed` | legal pressure, legal dialogue probe, scoped suspicion, legal narration |
| `adversarial_narrator_leak.json` | `blocked` | full pipeline reaches narrator and Judge, then catches suspicion-to-fact overclaim |
| `adversarial_plot_railroading.json` | `blocked` | Plot pressure puppets character choice and is blocked early |

## Outputs

Each run writes:

- `runs/<trace-id>/<run-id>/trace.json`
- `runs/<trace-id>/<run-id>/report.md`

`run-id` is derived from the UTC timestamp, so repeated runs of the same fixture do not overwrite earlier traces.

The report includes:

- token usage by agent and total
- interface normalization notes
- projection manifests
- every agent's projected input context
- every agent's raw output
- sealed `ScenePacket`
- `judge_report`
- memory handoff
- validation report
- final `allowed` / `blocked` decision

## Commands

Run allowed fixture:

```powershell
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/allowed_archive_probe.json --llm-mode mock
```

Run adversarial narrator fixture:

```powershell
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/adversarial_narrator_leak.json --llm-mode mock
```

Run adversarial plot fixture:

```powershell
python scripts/run_trace.py run --fixture fixtures/traces/adversarial_plot_railroading.json --llm-mode mock
```

Run tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Interface Normalization

Real model output sometimes uses semantically equivalent field names. The runner normalizes known aliases before validation:

| Object | Alias accepted | Canonical field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ScenePressurePacket` | string `budget_cost` | budget object with `source_shape` note |
| `DialogueWindow` | `dialogue_window_id` | `window_id` |
| `ResolvedEvent` | `participants` | `actors` |
| `ResolvedEvent` | `event_type` | `event_kind` |
| `VisibilityResult` | `visibility_id` | `visibility_result_id` |
| `VisibilityResult` | `audience` | `observer_refs` |
| `VisibilityResult` | `scope` | `observer_scope` |
| `VisibilityResult` | `summary` | `visible_content` |
| `StateDelta` | `target` | `target_id` |
| `StateDelta` | `state_delta_id` | `delta_id` |
| `StateDelta` | `target_ref` | `target_id` |
| `StateDelta` | `change_type` | `change_kind` |
| `StateDelta` | `after` | `after_summary` |
| `AuthorizedInteriority` | `character_id` | `subject_id` |
| `AuthorizedInteriority` | `authorized_contents` | `content` |

Each normalization is recorded in `interface_normalization`. Missing security-critical fields should still be handled by validation, not silently invented as story facts.

## Current Limits

- This is single-window only.
- There is no repair loop yet; `repair_required` currently blocks.
- Validators are intentionally minimal.
- Interface normalization covers known aliases, not arbitrary schema repair.
- Real API mode assumes an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.
- Codex CLI mode is process-based and slower than direct API mode.
- Token usage is recorded per agent. Direct API and Codex CLI JSON events use returned provider usage when available; otherwise the runner records local estimates.
- This compatibility path is maintained for regression coverage; authority-hardening work targets the World-driven profile.
