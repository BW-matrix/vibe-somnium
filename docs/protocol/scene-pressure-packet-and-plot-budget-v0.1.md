# ScenePressurePacket and Plot Pressure Budget v0.1

This document defines the first concrete payload and budget policy for `ScenePressurePacket`.

The goal is to let `Plot Agent` create tension without becoming a hidden god-author.

`Plot Agent` may introduce pressure. It may not choose character actions, declare world facts, or guarantee outcomes.

Runtime status:

- this document defines the general pressure law
- the executable World-driven profile uses `PlotPulse`, `PressureLedger`, `OptionTopologyCheck`, and explicit `PlotPulseDisposition`; see [world-driven-runtime-v0.1](world-driven-runtime-v0.1.md)

## Purpose

`ScenePressurePacket` exists to solve five protocol problems:

1. make plot pressure inspectable instead of vague authorial force
2. distinguish pressure from committed fact
3. prevent pressure from secretly determining character choices
4. require pressure to declare scope, duration, dependencies, and forbidden outcomes
5. give `World Agent` a clear boundary for translating pressure into actual scene conditions

Without this schema, `plot provides pressure, not destiny` remains correct as a slogan but weak as a runtime constraint.

## Design Constraints

Plot pressure should satisfy these constraints:

1. it must be bounded by scope and duration
2. it must preserve at least one meaningful non-forced option
3. it must cite its structural basis
4. it must not create world facts directly
5. it must not smuggle latent canon or hidden truth into agent context

## ScenePressurePacket Shape

Suggested payload fields:

| Field | Required | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pressure_id` | yes | string | stable id for this pressure packet |
| `scene_id` | yes | string | parent scene |
| `beat_id` | recommended | string | structural beat if applicable |
| `pressure_kind` | yes | string | category of pressure |
| `scope` | yes | string | executable scope enum listed below |
| `duration` | yes | string | executable duration enum listed below |
| `affected_options` | yes | array | options made harder, costlier, more urgent, or more visible |
| `non_forcing_clause` | yes | string | how character agency remains open |
| `world_fact_dependency` | recommended | array | existing facts or public/canon refs this pressure depends on |
| `world_translation_request` | optional | object | request for `World Agent` to decide whether pressure can become a condition |
| `forbidden_outcomes` | yes | array | outcomes the pressure packet is not allowed to require |
| `visibility` | yes | string | who may know this pressure exists |
| `budget_cost` | recommended | object | how much structural force this pressure spends |
| `based_on` | yes | array | structure, event, canon, or prior packet refs |

Important rule:

- `ScenePressurePacket` is input pressure
- it is not a committed scene event

## Allowed Pressure Kinds

| Pressure kind | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deadline` | time limit or approaching decision point | inspection begins at dawn |
| `resource_scarcity` | limited tool, time, trust, money, access, safety | only one archive key remains available |
| `social_exposure` | risk of being observed, challenged, or judged | servants are gathering near the corridor |
| `institutional_constraint` | legal, bureaucratic, ritual, or command pressure | the court requires a signed record by sunset |
| `relationship_strain` | tension inside an established relationship | Lin has less patience for Wei's evasions |
| `moral_dilemma` | values conflict without forced answer | protecting one person may endanger another |
| `environmental_pressure` | weather, darkness, noise, terrain, crowding | the storm makes quiet travel difficult |
| `information_asymmetry` | uneven access to public or private fragments | Lin knows one clue Wei does not know Lin heard |
| `escalation_signal` | signal that stakes are rising without choosing result | guards have begun asking procedural questions |

These nine values are the complete executable `pressure_kind` allowlist. The executable `scope` allowlist is `beat`, `scene`, `sequence`, `subscene`, `location`, `relationship`, `institution`, and `timeline`. The executable `duration` allowlist is `one_window`, `next_beat`, `next_two_beats`, `scene`, `chapter`, `scheduled`, and `until_condition`. Unknown values are hard-blocked; they are not normalized as creative synonyms. The projected Plot output schema contains these exact enums.

## Forbidden Pressure Kinds

The following are not legal pressure:

- "Character X must choose Y"
- "World outcome Z must happen"
- "The hidden canon fact is true and should now shape the scene" without legal reveal path
- "Narrator should make this feel inevitable" as a factual directive
- "A convenient new rule appears"
- "A secret witness arrives" unless `World Agent` validates an existing or scheduled basis

Important rule:

- if pressure requires a new fact, it must be routed as `world_translation_request` or `CanonMutationRequest`
- Plot cannot create the fact itself

## Plot Pressure Budget

Pressure budget prevents every beat from becoming a forced crisis.

Suggested budget fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intensity` | yes | low, medium, high |
| `novelty` | recommended | recurring, escalated, new |
| `stacking_count` | recommended | how many active pressures affect the same choice space |
| `relief_available` | recommended | whether the scene still permits pause, retreat, or alternate route |
| `agency_risk` | yes | low, medium, high |

Budget rules:

1. high or critical pressure requires stronger `non_forcing_clause`
2. repeated pressure on the same choice must show why it is not railroading
3. pressure should usually make options costly, not impossible
4. if all options but one are removed, the packet should be quarantined or rewritten
5. `agency_risk = high` requires `Authority Judge` review before World translation

## Cumulative Pressure Ledger

Single-packet legality does not prove that a sequence preserves agency. The executable runtime therefore records every approved pulse in a scene-local `PressureLedger` and validates cumulative pressure before it can be presented to World.

The cumulative check records:

- active pressure count and cumulative intensity
- same-option stacking
- current meaningful option ids
- whether a refusal path remains
- whether a non-plot-compliant but world-legal alternative remains
- whether relief or agency restoration is required

`OptionTopologyCheck` blocks a pulse when pressure removes every meaningful option but one, repeatedly targets one predetermined outcome, or lacks the declared alternatives needed to substantiate its `non_forcing_clause`.

## Non-Forcing Clause

Every pressure packet must state how meaningful choice remains open.

Good clauses:

- "Lin may confront Wei, delay the question, call a witness, or retreat to gather evidence."
- "The deadline raises cost, but it does not decide whether Wei lies, confesses, or redirects."
- "The crowd increases exposure, but characters may still choose silence, public accusation, or private negotiation."

Bad clauses:

- "Wei must confess because pressure is high."
- "Lin has no choice but to accuse."
- "The scene should force the reveal now."

## World Translation Boundary

Some pressure is purely structural. Some pressure wants to become a world condition.

| Pressure request | Who decides if it becomes fact | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| approaching deadline based on established schedule | `World Agent` | may translate if schedule exists |
| crowd gathering in a location | `World Agent` | needs location and cause basis |
| guard arrival | `World Agent` | needs prior route, order, or probability model |
| new institution command | `Canon Steward` if it creates or changes institution law | Plot cannot declare it |
| hidden canon clue becoming active | `Canon Steward` and reveal rules | must not leak raw latent canon |

Important rule:

- `World Agent` may accept, downgrade, transform, or reject a translation request
- rejected translation may still remain as structure note, but not as fact

In the executable runtime, every approved `PlotPulse` must receive an explicit World-owned `PlotPulseDisposition` before scene completion. Allowed dispositions are:

- `accepted`: World may bind it to an existing world condition or translate it through a source-bound adjudication
- `downgraded`: World may bind a weaker form to an existing condition or create it through a source-bound adjudication
- `deferred`: the pulse remains non-factual and cannot affect the current scene
- `rejected`: the pulse is consumed without world effect

The Kernel cannot synthesize a final disposition. If a pulse is still pending, it forces another World tick and another Authority review.

If an approved Character proposal is pending in that same tick, World adjudicates the proposal and disposes the pulse as two distinct authority acts. Both ids appear in `consumed_input_refs`; Plot pressure does not replace the proposal as adjudication input and the proposal does not make the pressure disappear.

For `accepted` or `downgraded`, `world_condition_refs` may cite only conditions already registered in World context unless the same tick includes an adjudication that commits exactly one new event. Every resulting state delta must cite that event. `deferred` and `rejected` require an empty condition-ref list and no adjudication.

## Field Projection and Visibility

Not every agent receives the same pressure view.

| Recipient | Legal pressure view |
| --- | --- |
| `Character Agent` | public or character-perceivable pressure only |
| `World Agent` | full pressure packet needed for adjudication, excluding plot-only destiny language |
| `Narrator Agent` | only pressure that is committed into `NarratorInputPacket` or render bounds |
| `Canon Steward` | only canon-relevant pressure requests |
| `Runtime Kernel` | full routing and structural-validation metadata; no semantic pressure judgment |
| `Authority Judge` | subject-specific audit context needed to review agency and grounding |

Important rule:

- pressure may guide scene setup
- it must not reveal hidden authorial intent to characters

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| missing or unknown `pressure_kind`, `scope`, or `duration` | hard block; Plot currently has no repair loop |
| missing `non_forcing_clause` | quarantine until repaired |
| missing `visibility` | quarantine unless route has one unique legal value |
| pressure specifies character choice | hard block |
| pressure specifies world outcome | reroute to `World Agent` as translation request or hard block |
| pressure depends on new canon | reroute to `CanonMutationRequest` |
| pressure uses raw hidden cognition | quarantine |
| pressure stacks too heavily | downgrade, split, or require budget review |

Executable normalization is intentionally narrower than this conceptual repair table. The only current recoverable synonym is `budget_cost.intensity = moderate`, normalized to `medium` with a warning and a `NormalizationRecord` containing path, policy, and before/after values. The raw model output remains in the trace. Missing or malformed security-critical, authority, identity, visibility, source, target, or canon fields are never normalized, and Plot currently has no retry loop.

All pulse and disposition identifiers obey the executable protocol-id grammar and replay checks. An inactive `deferred` or `rejected` disposition carrying an adjudication is quarantined even when the adjudication is otherwise well formed; World cannot disguise a Plot-authored world change behind an inactive label.

## Hard Boundaries

`Plot Agent` may:

- create urgency
- raise cost
- highlight unresolved tension
- request world translation
- track structural escalation

`Plot Agent` may not:

- puppet characters
- declare objective events
- decide success or failure
- reveal hidden canon
- make narrator overclaim inevitability
- use private memories as free omniscient planning material

## Relationship to Adjacent Specs

This document should be read together with:

- `communication-permission-matrix-v0.1.md`
- `agent-constraint-matrix-v0.1.md`
- `resolution-state-delta-commit-pipeline-v0.1.md`
- `agent-context-packet-and-field-visibility-v0.1.md`

Current executable status:

1. adversarial fixtures cover railroading, hidden-fact smuggling, option collapse, and cumulative over-stacking
2. every pending pulse requires an explicit source-bound World disposition before final commit
3. existing-condition reuse and new-condition adjudication are separate validated branches
4. remaining work is multi-scene budget persistence and empirical calibration of intensity costs
