# ScenePacket Schema v0.1

This document defines the first concrete schema for `ScenePacket`.

`ScenePacket` is the protocol's committed handoff object between world adjudication and downstream narration or memory work.

It is the main structure that turns "resolved scene reality" into "legal narrative source material."

Runtime status:

- this document defines the general packet contract
- [world-driven-runtime-v0.1](world-driven-runtime-v0.1.md) is the normative executable v0.2 profile
- the executable profile treats the packet as the atomic scene-transaction output and attaches a deterministic `SealingRecord`

## Purpose

`ScenePacket` exists to solve four protocol problems at once:

1. give `Orchestrator` one committed source object from which `NarratorInputPacket` can be projected
2. prevent raw `DialogueWindow` or hidden world state from being narrated directly
3. separate resolved consequence from mere proposal or pressure
4. provide a stable bridge from scene execution into memory and manuscript layers

Without `ScenePacket`, the rule `narrator cannot invent facts` remains a principle without a sufficiently concrete handoff structure.

## Design Constraints

`ScenePacket` should satisfy these constraints:

1. Its scene-reality fields must contain only committed material; pending governance candidates remain clearly typed, system-restricted records rather than story facts.
2. It must distinguish objective consequence from public knowledge.
3. It must expose interiority only through explicit authorization.
4. It must preserve local knowledge and avoid hidden omniscience leakage.
5. It must be useful both for prose rendering and later memory summarization.

## Placement in the Protocol

Recommended loop:

1. `World Agent` advances simulation and requests owner decisions when required
2. `Character Agent` submits an `EventProposal` through Router and Authority gates
3. `World Agent` resolves approved proposals, schedules, or Plot translations
4. `Authority Judge` reviews each exact adjudication before transaction-local acceptance
5. `Runtime Kernel` projects narration checkpoints from visible accepted events
6. `Runtime Kernel` seals committed material into `ScenePacket` after successful scene completion
7. memory layers and manuscript layers inherit from the packet rather than from raw proposals

Important rule:

- complete `ScenePacket` is a system object, not a default agent prompt object
- `Narrator Agent` may read `NarratorInputPacket` projected from committed `ScenePacket`
- `Narrator Agent` may not read raw hidden truth, rejected branches, or unresolved proposals as factual input

## Source Layers and Read Policy

`ScenePacket` is assembled from multiple layers, but not all layers contribute in the same way.

| Layer | May contribute to `ScenePacket` | Conditions | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `world_state_ledger` | yes | only committed, scene-relevant, resolution-backed material | this is the objective source of what actually happened |
| `public_event_ledger` | yes | when the scene causes something to become publicly knowable | needed for shared-knowledge consequences |
| `private_memory` | limited | only through explicit `authorized_interiority` or POV authorization | preserves local knowledge while allowing controlled inner access |
| `public_canon` | limited | only render-relevant or causally necessary references | keeps setting-grounded narration stable |
| `latent_canon` | no direct raw read | only if a reveal has been explicitly legalized and included as packet material | prevents narrator leakage of hidden canon |

This means `ScenePacket` may indirectly reflect multiple layers, but it should never act like a free omniscient dump.

## Packet Shape

The fields below describe the packet payload.

| Field | Required | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packet_id` | yes | string | stable id for this committed packet |
| `scene_id` | yes | string | parent scene identity |
| `packet_scope` | yes | string | scene, subscene, or window-group scope |
| `commit_status` | yes | string | `committed` or `quarantined` in executable v0.2; narrator may only use committed |
| `pov_contract` | yes | object | the viewpoint and interiority rules for narration |
| `resolved_events` | yes | array | what objectively happened in this packet span |
| `state_deltas` | yes | array | committed changes to world state |
| `visibility_deltas` | recommended | array | what became visible to whom |
| `publication_candidates` | optional | array | committed material that may qualify for `public_event_ledger` after threshold review |
| `public_event_deltas` | optional | array | approved publication records only |
| `authorized_interiority` | optional | array | explicitly permitted inner material for narration |
| `canon_reveal_candidates` | optional | array | committed material that may expose `latent_canon` but still needs governance |
| `canon_effects_committed` | optional | array | approved canon reveal or mutation effects only |
| `narration_bounds` | recommended | object | what narration may compress, must preserve, or must not claim |
| `based_on` | recommended | array | source resolution ids, state refs, or packet lineage |
| `sealing_record` | yes in executable v0.2 | object | deterministic source collections, hashes, included refs, and assembly policy |

Compatibility note:

- older drafts used `public_event_deltas` and `canon_effects` for both candidates and committed effects
- going forward, candidate fields and approved delta fields should be kept separate

## `pov_contract`

`pov_contract` defines how much interior access the packet grants.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | yes | external, limited, close, or first_person |
| `focal_agent_id` | recommended | whose viewpoint governs narration |
| `knowledge_ceiling` | recommended | the maximum knowledge level narration may assume |
| `interiority_policy` | yes | whether inner material is forbidden, selective, or primary |
| `multi_agent_policy` | optional | whether more than one mind may be represented in this packet |

Important rule:

- `pov_contract` is not a style suggestion
- it is an authority boundary for what narration may claim

## `resolved_events`

Each packet should contain one or more `resolved_events`.

These are not proposals. They are already-adjudicated scene facts.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `event_id` | yes | stable event identifier |
| `event_kind` | yes | dialogue, movement, confrontation, discovery, injury, reveal, etc. |
| `actors` | yes | which agents or characters were involved |
| `outcome` | yes | what factually happened |
| `visibility` | yes | who can directly know this event from the scene itself |
| `causal_basis` | recommended | what resolution or rule basis produced this event |
| `public_surface` | yes in executable v0.2 | externally projectable semantic surface, distinct from objective outcome |
| `spoken_line_records` | yes in executable v0.2 | committed paraphrased semantics or exact committed wording |
| `authorized_interiority` | yes in executable v0.2 | zero or more owner-grant-bound interiority records |
| `commit_status` | yes in executable v0.2 | must equal `committed` inside a successful transaction |

## `state_deltas`

`state_deltas` describe what changed in committed world state.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `delta_id` | yes | stable delta id |
| `target_kind` | yes | character, object, location, relation, resource, etc. |
| `target_id` | yes | what changed |
| `change` | yes | the committed state change |
| `persistence` | optional | temporary, scene-long, chapter-long, persistent |

## `visibility_deltas`

This field prevents a collapse between "event happened" and "everyone now knows it."

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visibility_result_id` | yes in executable v0.2 | stable visibility result id |
| `source_event_id` | yes in executable v0.2 | committed event whose visibility is being recorded |
| `scope` | yes | `private_self`, `private_target`, `scene_pair`, `restricted_subset`, scoped public, or `system_restricted` |
| `scope_ref` | yes in executable v0.2 | concrete owner, scene, location, institution, city, or realm scope instance |
| `observer_refs` | yes | explicit direct observers; public membership remains registry-based |
| `limits` | yes in executable v0.2 | semantic boundary on what observation does and does not reveal |

Executable ownership rules:

- `private_self` has exactly one observer equal to the event's `actors[0]`, and `scope_ref` names that owner
- `scene_pair` has exactly two unique current scene participants and includes every event actor
- visibility result fields exactly preserve the source event's visibility object

## `authorized_interiority`

This field is the main safeguard against narrator overreach.

It is the only packet-level route by which inner material may legally enter narration unless the POV contract itself already allows full focal interiority.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subject_id` | yes | whose interiority is being exposed |
| `access_mode` | yes | feeling, thought, memory, motive, suppression, uncertainty |
| `content` | yes | the authorized inner material |
| `authority_basis` | yes | why this interiority is legal to narrate |
| `scope_limit` | optional | one line, one beat, this packet only, etc. |

Important rule:

- absence of `authorized_interiority` should be treated as absence of permission
- narrator must not infer full interiority from consequence alone unless the POV contract allows it
- executable v0.2 also requires every interiority record to copy the Character-owned `interiority_grant` source field exactly and preserve its source hash; World cannot synthesize owner interiority

## `publication_candidates` and `public_event_deltas`

`publication_candidates` should only mark that committed scene material might qualify for public event publication.

Suggested candidate shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate_id` | yes | stable candidate id |
| `source_event_ids` | yes | committed events that might support publication |
| `publication_mode_hint` | recommended | possible threshold class |
| `proposed_scope` | recommended | possible public scope |
| `public_summary_candidate` | yes | what could be published if approved |
| `review_status` | yes | candidate, approved, rejected, or deferred |

Important rule:

- `publication_candidates` are not yet `public_event_ledger` entries
- `public_event_deltas` should appear only after threshold approval
- pending candidates are system-restricted, carry decision/expiry state, and are excluded from Character, Plot, and Narrator projections

## `canon_reveal_candidates` and `canon_effects_committed`

`canon_reveal_candidates` should only appear when the packet includes committed material that may legally expose hidden canon.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate_id` | yes | stable reveal candidate id |
| `canon_ref` | recommended | which canon element is affected |
| `reveal_basis` | yes | committed event, evidence, testimony, or declaration basis |
| `exposure_scope` | recommended | who may legally access the exposure |
| `review_status` | yes | candidate, approved, rejected, deferred |

`canon_effects_committed` should appear only after `Canon Steward` approval or an explicit no-review-needed decision.

Important rule:

- raw `latent_canon` should not be injected into narration through this field
- candidates must not be narrated as approved public canon
- only legalized reveal material belongs in `canon_effects_committed`
- pending reveal candidates are readable only by the creating World step and Authority audit in the current executable profile

## `narration_bounds`

`narration_bounds` tells the downstream prose layer what flexibility it has.

Suggested shape:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `must_preserve` | recommended | facts, order, wording, or constraints narration must preserve |
| `may_compress` | recommended | what may be summarized rather than shown beat-by-beat |
| `must_not_claim` | yes | facts or minds the narrator may not assert |
| `ordering_flex` | optional | whether exact order may be reordered for prose clarity |

## Hard Boundaries

`ScenePacket` may contain:

- committed scene facts
- committed state change
- explicit visibility consequences
- explicitly authorized inner material

`ScenePacket` may not contain:

- rejected branches
- unresolved proposals
- free omniscient hidden truth
- raw chain-of-thought dumps
- unapproved latent canon presented as public fact
- candidate publication or reveal material presented as approved delta

## Commit Semantics

A `ScenePacket` should count as `committed` only when all of the following are true:

1. included `resolved_events` already have world adjudication
2. included `state_deltas` have been accepted as committed world change
3. visibility consequences have been resolved to the needed level
4. any publication-relevant content is clearly separated as candidate or approved publication
5. any canon-relevant content is either approved, explicitly marked as candidate, or excluded from factual narration
6. the packet has been sealed by `Orchestrator` with source references

Executable v0.2 replaces the legacy `Orchestrator` in condition 6 with deterministic `Runtime Kernel` sealing. It also requires:

7. the complete scene transaction reached `finish_scene` without any late block
8. every accepted adjudication and Plot disposition has an exact Authority approval
9. all run-local identities and consumable inputs passed single-use replay checks
10. the sealing record hashes every included source collection and the pre-seal packet payload; rollback moves quarantined adjudication ids to `excluded_refs` instead of source refs

The public sample exporter first verifies this private seal. Because removing a private `run_id` changes `packet_id` and therefore the payload hash, it then recomputes collection hashes and attaches a distinct `seal_scope = sanitized_public_export` seal. A private seal is never presented as if it directly authenticated a redacted payload.

Narrator rule:

- a post-commit `NarratorInputPacket` requires `commit_status = committed`
- executable v0.2 instead projects a transaction-local `NarrationCheckpoint` from already accepted World events before outward packet commit; its prose remains unpublished working material until the scene transaction succeeds
- draft packets may be reviewed by system layers but must not be treated as externally published prose source material
- pending `publication_candidates` and `canon_reveal_candidates` must be excluded from factual narration unless separately approved and projected
- if any later validation fails, the packet is outwardly empty of resolved facts, narration is unpublished, and transaction-local state/prose is retained only as quarantined audit material

For the full commit pipeline and two-phase semantics, see [resolution-state-delta-commit-pipeline-v0.1](resolution-state-delta-commit-pipeline-v0.1.md).

## Projection Rule

Complete `ScenePacket` should remain system-level. Agents receive views:

| View | Recipient | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ScenePacketView` | eligible Character, Plot, World, or Canon roles | role-specific committed slice |
| `NarratorInputPacket` | `Narrator Agent` | legal factual prose input |
| `owner_projection` | packet-to-memory handoff | owner-specific memory derivation |

For field-level projection, see [agent-context-packet-and-field-visibility-v0.1](agent-context-packet-and-field-visibility-v0.1.md).

- `resolution-state-delta-commit-pipeline-v0.1.md`

Current executable status:

1. projection and candidate-leakage fixtures are implemented
2. Narrator output carries a claim map and receives an Authority grounding review
3. scene publication and packet-to-memory handoff are atomic with late-failure rollback
4. working narration is explicitly separated from published and quarantined narration
5. remaining work includes multi-scene packet chains and in-loop canon/publication promotion
