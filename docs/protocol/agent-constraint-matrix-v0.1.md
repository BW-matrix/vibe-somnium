# Agent Constraint Matrix v0.1

This document expands the high-level protocol draft into implementation-oriented tables.

Columns are agent types. Rows are constraint items.

The goal is not to freeze every detail right now, but to create a stable matrix that later message schemas, storage design, and scene-loop code can inherit from.

Runtime status:

- this matrix remains the conceptual role baseline
- [world-driven-runtime-v0.1](world-driven-runtime-v0.1.md) is the normative executable v0.2 profile
- the executable profile replaces the legacy `Orchestrator` umbrella with three narrower components

## Legend

- `allow`: normal protocol behavior
- `limited`: only under an explicit scope or policy
- `indirect`: must go through another layer or agent
- `no`: not permitted by default

## Communication Constraint Matrix

| Constraint | Character Agent | World Agent | Plot Agent | Narrator Agent | Canon Steward | Orchestrator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary communication question | What do I want, do, or say now? | What actually happens next? | What pressure enters now? | How does committed state become prose? | Can this new fact legally exist? | Can the system route this safely? |
| Normal outbound message types | `Intent`, `ActionProposal`, `DialogueWindow`, `SelfNote` | `Observation`, `Resolution`, `StateDelta`, `CanonQuery`, `CanonMutationRequest` | `Pressure`, `EscalationSeed`, `ScenePressurePacket` | `Narration`, `SceneDraft`, `StyleNote` | `CanonDecision`, `CanonDelta`, `CanonClarification` | `Warning`, `RepairRequest`, `RouteNotice`, `ScenePacket`, `QuarantineNotice` |
| Normal inbound message types | `Observation`, public `Pressure`, `Warning`, projected `ScenePacketView` | `Intent`, `ActionProposal`, `DialogueWindow`, `CanonDecision`, `Warning` | projected `ScenePacketView`, structure summary, `Warning` | `NarratorInputPacket`, approved style guide, `Warning` | `CanonQuery`, `CanonMutationRequest`, `CanonReviewContext`, `Warning` | all envelopes, validation metadata |
| Default target | `world` | involved agents, event bus, `canon steward` if needed | scene bus, `world`, or structure bus | manuscript layer | `world` and `orchestrator` | any agent or system layer |
| Default visibility | `private_self` for raw cognition; `private_target` for transformed proposals | `system_restricted` until state is committed | `scene_public` for active pressure; `system_restricted` for structure-only notes | `system_restricted` until prose is committed | `system_restricted` | `system_restricted` |
| Raw cognition exposure rule | self only | no raw access | no raw access | limited to explicit POV-authorized extracts | no raw access | no raw access |
| Missing-field handling | warn and request repair | warn and hold unsafe resolution | warn and downgrade or defer | warn and defer render | warn and defer decision | normalize recoverable fields only; quarantine unsafe security-critical gaps |
| Ambiguity handling | clarify intent or narrow scope | ask for repair before consequence commit | downgrade pressure or defer to next beat | ask for grounded packet before render | require rationale before canon decision | issue route warning and preserve flow |
| Privacy breach handling | quarantine outbound message | quarantine unsafe input and refuse hidden-mind inference | quarantine leaked private cognition | reject render built on unauthorized cognition | quarantine request | quarantine envelope and notify sender |
| Hard block if message attempts to | declare objective outcome, declare other minds, alter canon | bypass canon, ignore rules for drama, write inner minds | puppet characters, declare facts, edit canon | invent facts, leak latent canon, rewrite committed events | alter immutable canon or decide scene outcome | rewrite creative content or hide authority breach |
| Normal cadence | one dramatic move per window | one resolution cycle per window | one pressure packet per scene or major beat | one render pass per committed scene packet | event-triggered only | continuous lightweight supervision |
| Default granularity | `dramatic window` | `dramatic window` | scene-level or act-level pressure | scene packet or subscene packet | event-level | envelope-level |
| Dialogue handling | submit speech act and optional candidate lines | resolve visible dialogue consequences and information flow | inject pressure, not line-by-line speech | render final spoken lines from committed window | no dialogue role | enforce window boundaries and pacing rules |
| Interrupt policy | limited to immediate danger, forced choice, or sharp revelation | may interrupt to reject impossible or unsafe action | limited to scheduled escalation trigger | no interrupt during active causality loop | interrupt only on canon breach | may interrupt any unsafe route |
| Allowed fallback on malformed input | retry with narrowed action | safe no-op, hold, or ask repair | defer escalation | skip render for current packet | defer canon mutation | preserve system continuity whenever authority is not violated |

## Shared Notes

### 1. Soft validation, hard permission

Malformed communication should usually trigger `warning`, `repair`, or `normalization`.

Authority violations should trigger `quarantine` or `hard block`.

This keeps the system resilient without letting roles melt together.

Security-critical field failures are not ordinary malformed communication. Missing or ambiguous `sender`, `message_type`, `visibility`, `target`, `authority_basis`, or `authorized_interiority.scope_limit` should quarantine or require explicit repair unless the route context has exactly one legal value.

The same fail-closed rule covers malformed JSON container types and protocol identifiers. Executable identifiers are bounded strings matching `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{0,127}$`; invalid, duplicate, or replayed identities are blocked before projection. A `trace_id` is additionally restricted to one portable filesystem segment (`^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_.-]{0,127}$`, excluding Windows reserved names and trailing dots), validated before any output directory is created, and its resolved run path must remain below the resolved output root. Validator exceptions are converted into structural block records rather than escaping the scene loop.

### 2. Private cognition, public consequence

`Character Agent` may carry much richer inner cognition than what leaves the self boundary.

The world should only receive transformed action, dialogue, or decision proposals.

This preserves secrecy, misunderstanding, delayed revelation, and genuine local knowledge.

### 3. Dramatic window over single utterance

The default unit of coordination is a `dramatic window`, not one line of dialogue.

One window may contain:

- one short exchange
- one negotiation move
- one emotional turn
- one conceal / probe / reveal attempt

This is the main protection against slow, over-fragmented scene execution.

### 4. Narrator is bound to committed packets

`Narrator Agent` may compress, stylize, sequence, and voice-shape events.

It may not add new facts, recover rejected branches, or smuggle latent canon into prose.

Operationally, `Narrator Agent` should receive `NarratorInputPacket`, not the complete system `ScenePacket`.

### 5. Canon growth is explicit

`canon_origin = emergent` is allowed, but it must be reviewed and committed with separate visibility and stability axes.

No other agent should be able to solve a scene problem by silently creating lore.

### 6. Executable coordination roles

| Constraint | Runtime Kernel | Router Agent | Authority Judge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core authority | deterministic mechanics | exact owner routing | semantic permission review |
| May create story content | no | no | no |
| May read complete system objects | only as program data | no | limited subject-specific audit view |
| May alter reviewed content | no | no | no |
| May block progress | on structural, binding, replay, budget, or transaction failure | on invalid owner binding | on authority, grounding, visibility, or overreach failure |
| Required audit binding | projection and sealing manifests | request hash and owner id | subject hash, reviewed fields, authority basis, run nonce, review-context hash |
| Forbidden failure mode | editorial selection or semantic guessing | choice advice or story summary | rewriting the subject into an acceptable alternative |

Judge-generated ids and prose remain audit-only. A creative agent may receive code-only repairs tied to its own rejected subject, while an approved downstream wrapper carries a Kernel-derived authority-binding hash rather than a model-controlled review identifier.

## Current Follow-Ups

1. extend current adversarial fixtures from single-scene traces to multi-scene persistence
2. calibrate semantic Authority Judge reliability and disagreement handling
3. add live canon/publication governance to the World loop
4. retain the canon-vs-state classification checklist as a governance task
5. define dialogue-quality metrics only after runtime authority remains stable under real-provider samples
