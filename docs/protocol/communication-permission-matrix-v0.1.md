# Communication + Permission Matrix v0.1

This document is the first protocol draft for `vibe-somnium / 织梦`.

目标不是一次性定死全部实现，而是先给系统一个足够清晰的 law layer，让 agent swarm 不会重新塌回 hidden single-author mode。

## Protocol Axioms

1. `character decides intent`
2. `world decides consequence`
3. `plot decides pressure`
4. `narrator decides expression`
5. `canon steward decides canon mutation`
6. `orchestrator decides routing and validation`

## Master Matrix

| Constraint | Character Agent | World Agent | Plot Agent | Narrator Agent | Canon Steward | Orchestrator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core role | Subjective actor | Reality adjudicator | Structural pressure source | Prose renderer | Canon lawkeeper | Routing and guardrail layer |
| Core authority | Will, motive, choice, self-interpretation | Consequence, causality, state transition | Conflict pressure, pacing pressure, stakes escalation | Voice, pacing, textual rendering | Accept or reject canon mutations | Validate, route, schedule, quarantine |
| Primary output | `Intent`, `ActionProposal`, optional `DialogueWindow` | `Observation`, `Resolution`, `StateDelta` | `Pressure`, `EscalationSeed`, `ScenePressurePacket` | `Narration`, `SceneDraft` | `CanonDecision`, `CanonDelta` | `Warning`, `RepairRequest`, `ScenePacket`, scheduling directives |
| Allowed outbound message types | `Intent`, `ActionProposal`, `DialogueWindow`, `SelfNote` | `Observation`, `Resolution`, `StateDelta`, `CanonQuery`, `CanonMutationRequest` | `Pressure`, `EscalationSeed`, `ScenePressurePacket` | `Narration`, `SceneDraft`, `StyleNote` | `CanonDecision`, `CanonDelta`, `CanonClarification` | `Warning`, `RepairRequest`, `RouteNotice`, `ScenePacket`, `QuarantineNotice` |
| Allowed inbound message types | `Observation`, public `Pressure`, `Warning`, visible `ScenePacket` | `Intent`, `ActionProposal`, `DialogueWindow`, `CanonDecision`, `Warning` | public `ScenePacket`, global progress summaries, `Warning` | committed `ScenePacket`, approved style guide, `Warning` | `CanonQuery`, `CanonMutationRequest`, `Warning` | all message envelopes and validation metadata |
| Default visibility | `private_self` for raw cognition; `private_target` for proposals to world | `system_restricted` by default; public only through committed state | `scene_public` or `system_restricted` depending on pressure type | `system_restricted` until prose is committed | `system_restricted` | `system_restricted` |
| Read scope | Self biography, self memory, public canon, visible scene facts, public event ledger | World state ledger, public event ledger, canon, submitted proposals, rulesets | Global structure progress, public event ledger, relationship map, limited world-state summaries | Committed scene packet, authorized POV material, style guide | Full canon layers and canon change log, canon-relevant state | Envelope metadata, policy tables, validation rules |
| Private memory access | Full self memory only | No direct access to character raw memory | No direct access to character raw memory | Limited POV-scoped access only when authorized | Canon memory only | No literary private memory by default |
| Proposal scope | What I want, what I do, what I say, how I frame myself | What happens, what changes, what becomes visible | What pressure enters the scene | How committed events become prose | Whether a new fact enters canon | How messages move and whether they need repair |
| Commit scope | None on objective world state | May commit `Resolution` and `StateDelta` within current rules | None on factual story state | May commit manuscript text only, not facts | May commit `Emergent Canon` only | May commit routing results, validation outcomes, and scene packets |
| Cannot declare | Other minds, objective results, canon changes, guaranteed success | Character inner truth, theme meaning, plot intention, miraculous exceptions | Specific character choices, final outcomes, canon facts | New facts, retroactive fixes, hidden causal changes | Scene outcomes, character choices, prose facts outside canon review | Story content, character motive, canon invention |
| Cannot see | Other characters' raw cognition, hidden canon, rejected branches of others | Full unfiltered inner monologue unless explicitly transformed into action | Raw private cognition, narrator draft internals | Rejected branches, private canon review debate, raw hidden cognition unless authorized | Irrelevant private character cognition | Should avoid reading style content beyond what is needed for validation |
| Normal tempo | One dramatic move per window | One resolution cycle per window | One pressure packet per scene or major beat | One render pass per committed scene packet | Only on canon-triggering events | Continuous but lightweight supervision |
| Granularity | `dramatic window`, not single utterance | `dramatic window`, not single utterance | scene-level or act-level pressure | scene packet or subscene packet | event-triggered | per-envelope validation and routing |
| Failure behavior | Warn and request repair if message is malformed | Warn and hold resolution if action cannot be interpreted safely | Warn and downgrade pressure packet if ambiguous | Warn and reject prose if it invents facts | Warn and defer canon mutation if unsupported | Never crash the system on soft schema failure |
| Hard block conditions | Claims objective outcome, writes others' minds, changes canon | Violates canon, bypasses steward, ignores rules for drama | Puppeteers characters, declares facts, edits canon | Invents facts, leaks latent canon, rewrites events | Alters immutable canon without explicit override path | Silently rewrites content or becomes hidden author |

## Event Bus Policy

`event bus` should use a soft-validation pipeline. 格式错误不应该直接导致整轮崩掉，更不应该让系统因为小字段缺失而自杀。

Recommended pipeline:

1. `receive`
2. `inspect`
3. `warn`
4. `normalize if safe`
5. `request repair if needed`
6. `quarantine only if routing or authority is unsafe`
7. `continue scene with fallback`

The important distinction is:

- `schema failure` is usually a recoverable coordination issue
- `authority failure` is a protocol violation

## Message Envelope v0.1

Every routed message should try to include the following fields:

| Field | Purpose | Handling if missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message_id` | Traceability | event bus may generate one |
| `message_type` | Routing and allowlist check | if missing and not inferable, warn and quarantine |
| `sender` | Source identity | hard stop for this message only if unknown |
| `target` | Intended receiver | infer from route table if obvious; otherwise warn |
| `scene_id` | Scene grouping | inherit current scene if available |
| `window_id` | Dramatic window grouping | inherit current window if available |
| `visibility` | Privacy boundary | fill with agent default visibility |
| `payload` | Actual content | warn and request repair if unusable |
| `based_on` | Causal trace or references | optional, but recommended |

## Visibility Layers

| Visibility | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `private_self` | Raw cognition, hidden motive, self-only reflection |
| `private_target` | Only sender and explicit target may inspect |
| `scene_public` | Visible to all agents legitimately participating in the scene |
| `system_restricted` | Reserved for routing, canon review, or validation layers |

Important rule:

- raw inner intention stays in `private_self`
- only transformed intent or action proposal leaves the self boundary

## Dramatic Window Rule

系统默认不按“每一句台词”调度，而按 `dramatic window` 调度。

A dramatic window is a bounded unit of interaction that may contain:

- one short exchange
- one tactical move in a negotiation
- one emotional turn in an argument
- one attempt to conceal, probe, reveal, or deflect

This means a long dialogue does not require one full protocol cycle per utterance.

Default policy:

- one window may include one to three dialogue moves per active character
- narrator renders the result of the window, not every raw candidate line
- switch to finer granularity only when a critical trigger fires

Suggested critical triggers:

- deception is detected
- power relation changes sharply
- hidden information is revealed
- a character breaks prior behavior constraints
- dialogue turns into physical action
- a third party enters and changes the scene state

## Canon Layers

| Canon Layer | Meaning | Who may change it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Immutable Canon` | Fundamental world law, hard history anchors, core role definitions | No routine agent |
| `Latent Canon` | Already true but not yet revealed facts | Not changed during scene play; only revealed when valid |
| `Emergent Canon` | New facts allowed to grow during writing | `Canon Steward` after review |

For the complementary storage model covering `world_state_ledger`, `public_event_ledger`, and `private_memory`, see [state-and-knowledge-layers-v0.1](state-and-knowledge-layers-v0.1.md).

## Commit Rule

Only committed scene state may be read by `Narrator Agent` as factual source material.

This prevents:

- prose from smuggling rejected branches into the story
- narrator from turning possibilities into facts
- plot pressure from being mistaken for already-happened events

## Open Questions for v0.2

1. Per-agent message allowlist table at field-level granularity
2. Whether `DialogueWindow` should contain candidate lines or only speech acts
3. How much of private cognition may be selectively exposed to narrator in close POV modes
4. How scene packets should be summarized for long-form memory retention
5. Whether world resolution should be deterministic, probabilistic, or hybrid
